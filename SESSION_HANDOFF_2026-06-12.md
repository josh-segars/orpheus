# Session Handoff — 2026-06-12

Retires `SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-06-11.md`. Its threads resolved as follows:

- **Pickup 1 (combined post-deploy live run)** — still owed, now formalized and expanded as **ORPHEUS-82** (covers 74/77/66/temp-0/76 plus this session's 81/78). Partially pre-cleared in-session: the reports list rendered live against real data (band chips, rows, redirect) during the 81 rollout.
- **Pickup 2 (ORPHEUS-78 verbiage pass)** — shipped this session. Closed in Plane.
- **Pickup 3 (ORPHEUS-42)** — unchanged, carries forward.
- Between the handoffs, a **separate session** landed ORPHEUS-79 (Vercel Web Analytics + Speed Insights, `27e39f6`) and ORPHEUS-80 (CLS font fallbacks, `27e81a4`). Josh confirmed the live CLS re-measurement resolved at this session's wrap — both closed in Plane 2026-06-12.

Commits this session (all five already pushed by Josh; only this handoff commit is unpushed):

```
(this handoff + CLAUDE.md / PRODUCT_CONTEXT.md refresh)
134a6d0 ORPHEUS-81 fix: reports header alignment — title left, CTA right, vertically centered  ← pushed
3fe8cd9 ORPHEUS-81 fix: GET /jobs 500 — jobs.updated_at column doesn't exist                    ← pushed
eefa69d ORPHEUS-78: verbiage pass — 'View My' label, shortened dim names, Welcome card          ← pushed
24e4d50 ORPHEUS-81: reports list page + smart-redirect rework + run-new-report entry            ← pushed
dcaf5c8 ORPHEUS-81: backend jobs list endpoint + concurrent-run guard                           ← pushed
```

Session shape: ORPHEUS-81 started on Josh's direction ("we will also touch 62, 71, 78" — 62's Groundwork dead-end, 71's View-My-Reports note, 78's verbiage) → four decisions locked via multi-choice (block concurrent runs; questionnaire carries forward editable — turned out to be existing behavior, zero code; reports list always the landing surface; full 78 scope incl. dim short names locked as Signal Strength / Signal Quality / Alignment) → backend + frontend + prototype shipped in three ticket-scoped commits → Josh pushed and tested live → two live findings fixed same-day (the `updated_at` 500-as-CORS, the header cascade) → 81 + 78 closed, ORPHEUS-82 filed → **part 2:** Josh reported Andrew on his roster → data audit found no advisors row for Andrew + a dupe clients row → repaired live via Supabase MCP → ORPHEUS-83/84/85 filed → wrap.

## What this session shipped

### ORPHEUS-81 (`dcaf5c8` + `24e4d50` + fixes `3fe8cd9`, `134a6d0`) — multi-report support

- **Backend:** `GET /jobs` lists the caller's jobs newest-first as `JobSummary` (id, state, created_at, composite band joined from `scores.band` via the GET /clients bucketing pattern). Client-role-gated; advisor surface keeps its latest_job chip for v1. `POST /jobs` gains the concurrent-run guard — `_has_active_job` (pending/running) → 409 before uploads are read. 6 new pytest cases (`test_jobs_list.py`).
- **Frontend:** new `/reports` page (`ReportsPage` + `useJobs`, 5s poll while in flight) — complete rows link to the report with spectrum-pip band chips, in-flight rows link to Analysis, failed rows render statically; "Run a New Report" → Groundwork, replaced by an in-progress note while a job runs. `ClientPortalRedirect`: **any** job history → `/reports` (fixes the failed-latest dead-end; `useGroundworkProgress` gains `hasAnyJob`). Nav "View My Reports" → `/reports`. Report page secondary action → "← View My Reports" (deviates from Figma 5:133, which predates multi-report). 4 new vitest cases.
- **Questionnaire carry-forward** (locked decision) is existing behavior — answers persist per client, completion derived at read time — so re-runs arrive with that checklist item complete and editable. Zero code.
- **Prototype:** new `orpheus-reports-v1.html`; nav menu item wired across all pages.
- **Live findings fixed same-day:** (1) `GET /jobs` selected `jobs.updated_at` — column doesn't exist → PostgREST 400 → unhandled 500 surfacing as a *browser CORS error* (500s bypass CORSMiddleware). Third occurrence of the ORPHEUS-59/61 fixture-invents-the-schema anti-pattern; schema now verified via information_schema, `updated_at` dropped from both JobSummary contracts. (2) Reports header rendered stacked/right-aligned — shared `.section-header` is a flex column and the single-class override lost the cascade; fixed with `.section-header.reports-header` compound selector.

### ORPHEUS-78 (`eefa69d`) — verbiage pass, copy-only

"View **My** Quick Reference Card →" (Figma 5:135); dimension display names shortened via `DIM_DISPLAY_NAMES` (Profile Clarity / Signal Strength / Signal Quality / Alignment — internal names stay canonical in models, narrative keys, admin); Welcome's stale "Forward Brief" card retitled "Quick Reference Card". The Figma "Longitudinal Trend" icon deliberately not built — score-over-time is a product feature; 81 just laid its data foundation. Prototype backported.

### Part 2 — Andrew's advisor status repaired (no commits; cloud SQL via Supabase MCP)

Found: Andrew had **no advisors row** and his auth user had **two** clients rows under Josh's advisor ("Andrew Segars" andrew@ess3.ai with 2 jobs; "Drew" andrew.r.segars@gmail.com with 0) — an ORPHEUS-65 e2e artifact plus a dupe acceptance, breaking the one-clients-row-per-user invariant. Repaired and verified: new advisors row `351f9deb` (practice_name NULL — settable later), the 2-job row repointed as his `is_self` self-report row, the dupe deleted. Josh's roster: Josh (self) + Karen + Brandon. Andrew is dual-role on next sign-in (fresh session/reload needed — `useSessionRoles` caches with staleTime Infinity). ORPHEUS-83 holds the remaining structural work (partial unique index on `clients.user_id`, accept-invitation already-linked behavior).

### Tickets filed

**ORPHEUS-82** (live validation of 81/78 — absorbs the combined post-deploy run), **ORPHEUS-83** (above), **ORPHEUS-84** (admin-only invite-advisor; locked: admin-only for beta), **ORPHEUS-85** (self-serve client sign-up, pre-Stripe, house-advisor model; revises the 2026-05-11 invitation-only-beta decision — Decision Log entry due at ship; open-vs-gated sign-up flagged for Tim/Josh on cost posture).

### Verification

- Frontend: `tsc -b` clean, vitest **40 green** (36 → 40: +4 ReportsPage).
- Backend: py_compile clean; pytest expected **271 green** (265 + 6) — **unconfirmed, run from Josh's terminal**.
- Live: reports list, band chips, redirect, and both fixes verified by Josh against prod during the session.

## Recommended pickup for next session

1. **ORPHEUS-82** — the consolidated live validation run. Confirm Railway backend carries `3fe8cd9` and Vercel the post-`134a6d0` build first. A fresh job from either preserved profile covers the 81 run-guard + in-flight row, the second-person register (77), word specs (66), temp-0 determinism (Andrew's data → 83/Resonant exactly), and the 76/78 visual+copy checks. Note Andrew's fresh job now runs under *his own* advisor.
2. **ORPHEUS-83** — uniqueness-guard migration (small, well-scoped).
3. **ORPHEUS-84 / 85** — the roles + growth pair; 85 needs the open-vs-gated decision routed before build.

---

## Caveats / things that will bite

1. **Backend pytest count unconfirmed** — 271 expected; the handoff test baseline should be corrected if Josh's terminal disagrees.
2. **Andrew's advisors row has `practice_name` NULL** — invitation emails and admin labels fall back to his email until set.
3. **Andrew needs a fresh sign-in/reload** to pick up dual-role (session-roles cache is staleTime Infinity).
4. **Diagnostic shortcut, hard-won twice now:** a browser "CORS" error on an endpoint whose siblings work is almost always an unhandled 500 (FastAPI 500s skip CORSMiddleware headers). And new endpoint queries must be checked against information_schema — the fixture-invents-the-schema anti-pattern has now bitten three times (59/61/81).
5. **Free re-runs + (soon) free sign-up = unmetered pipeline cost** — the single-in-flight guard is the only throttle until ORPHEUS-85's gate decision / ORPHEUS-40 Stripe.
6. **Sandbox quirks unchanged:** no SSH push, `.git/*.lock` mv-workaround before commits, PyPI blocked.
7. **Untracked-by-intent files unchanged:** survey `.md` + `.gs`, `rubric_consistency_results_2026-06-10_112327.json` (keep/delete call still pending), compliance drafts.

## State of the repo right now (end of session)

Everything through `134a6d0` is pushed. This handoff + doc-refresh commit is the only unpushed work.

CLAUDE.md updated: Active phase gained the 79/80 note + the 81/78 + repair sentences; two new Decisions Made entries (81+78, Andrew repair + tickets); jobs.py tree line and Portal Pages table refreshed. PRODUCT_CONTEXT.md updated: API routes + Frontend build-status rows (vitest baseline 40). CONVENTIONS.md / CREDENTIALS.md untouched.

`SESSION_HANDOFF_2026-06-11.md` is retired in this commit.

Suggested push:

```bash
cd ~/git/orpheus && git push origin main
